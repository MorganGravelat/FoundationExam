/*
Anisa and Ben are trying to pick a name for their child. Based on their review of pseudoscience,
they’ve decided that they want the shortest name possible. If there are multiple shortest
names, they want the one that comes first alphabetically. Write a function that takes in a list of
possible names (type char**) and returns the name (char*) that they should choose amongst the
possible names in the input array, according to their criteria. Please use the appropriate functions
in string.h and do NOT allocate memory, free memory, OR print anything. (You’ll get an
automatic 0 if you do any of these things.) You may assume that the strings stored in
possibleNames only consist of lowercase letters. (Note: numNames represents the number of
names stored in the array possibleNames.)
